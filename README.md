# learning bash scripting

this repo is for bash noobs (like i used to be).  
i built what i wish i'd had when i started : simple scripts, clear steps, no jargon.  
it's not about advanced commands, and this will get you through more than 90% of what you'll ever need.

if you want to really learn, open the script yourself using a terminal based editor like nano, try changing the things inside like the 
parameters and then do `chmod +x file_name.sh` to make it executable and then run the file using `./file_name.sh` 
from the current directory .
